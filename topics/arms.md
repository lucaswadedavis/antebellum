# Arms

This section should cover the collection of arms that potential combatants would bring to bear immediately and those possible to develop in media reis. The collection should include, but not necessarily be limited to:

- Nuclear weapons
- Biological weapons (see The Dead Hand)
- Chemical weapons
- Terrorist cells
- Extremely large scale exchanges involving conventional forces (of the scale of WWI and WWII)
- Electro Magnetic Pulse (EMP) weapons
- The targeted elimination of systempunkts (see Brave New War)
